GNORDVPN-SPROKKEL78
-------------------

NOTES:
-----

- If you make changes to the setting TECHNOLOGY or PROTOCOL then you must reconnect
  for them to apply. The PROTOCOL setting can only be changed when using the OPENVPN
  Technology.

- The Meshnet Module can only be enabled with a working internet connection. 
  Without a working internet connection the app might take a while to respond and the desktop
  can popup a force-quit window.

- The routing setting can only be changed if Meshnet is disabled.
  
- Sending and receiving files with meshnet uses gnome-terminal for progress.

- Setting Custom DNS will disable Threat Protection Lite.

- Making changes to the obfuscate setting requires a reconnection to take effect.
- Obfuscate can only be enabled with OPENVPN Technology.

Pressing CTRL-q will quit the application.
Pressing CTRL-m will iconify the application.
