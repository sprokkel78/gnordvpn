GNORDVPN-SPROKKEL78
-------------------

NOTES:
-----

If you make changes to the setting TECHNOLOGY or PROTOCOL then you must reconnect
for them to apply. The PROTOCOL setting can only be changed when using the OPENVPN
Technology.

The Meshnet Module will only become available if you have a working internet connection. 
Without a working internet connection the app might take a while to respond and the desktop
can popup a force-quit window. If the internet connection drops the meshnet module will
become unavailable in the app.

Pressing CTRL-q will quit the application.
Pressing CTRL-m will iconify the application.
